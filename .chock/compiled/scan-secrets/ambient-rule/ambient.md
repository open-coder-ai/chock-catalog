Potential secret detected in this change. Remove credentials and rotate any exposed keys. '# pragma: allowlist secret' on the same line marks a documented test fixture; in the agent (tool use, the turn's end) it counts only when that exact line is already committed in HEAD, so an agent asks a person rather than writing the pragma itself.
