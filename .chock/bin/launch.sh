# chock hook launcher. Every agent hook chock writes runs:
#   git -c "alias.chock-hook=!sh .chock/bin/launch.sh" chock-hook <runtime.py> [args...]
# git runs the alias from the repository's top level under its own sh (bash, PowerShell
# and cmd.exe all pass that string through unchanged), so relative paths resolve and no
# absolute interpreter path is ever committed. This script picks the first Python that
# actually runs: `chock.python` (written into .git/config by `chock sync`), then PATH.
# A candidate must execute, not merely exist: Windows' python3.exe Store alias exists and
# exits 9009. With no working Python it refuses (exit 2) and says why -- never allows.
